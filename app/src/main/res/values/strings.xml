        Legend of the lost chef is a dungeon seek and find adventure-game. It contains no violance, even though there is a sword button for swinging the sword. The original plan was to make a hack-n-slash game, but since I made this kinds of games before I instead added characters that you can interact with and talk with to make the story more alive.

How to play:\n
You draw a walking vector in the direction you want to walk.
Where you start or end the vector does not matter. Only the direction of the vector matters.\n
\n
You can talk with characters by walking up to them. You can also swing your sword with the sword button, but this is as mentioned only a special effect for fun\n
\n
Win condition\n
The game ends when you have successfully found and rescued the Chef that is gone\n
